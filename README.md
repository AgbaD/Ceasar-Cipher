# Ceasar-Cipher
A message encryption software based on the cipher created by Julius Ceasar.
The cipher works based on the ceasar algorithm
For every key given, the software rerurns a different encryption

During decryption, if the wrong key is typed in, the actual message would not be gotten
This makes the key the most important factor here
